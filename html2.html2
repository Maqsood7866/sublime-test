  <p class="hightlight">A chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a kind of domesticated bird. It is raised in many places for its meat and eggs.[1] They are usually kept by humans as livestock. Most breeds of chickens can fly for a short distance. Some sleep in trees if there are trees around.></p>

  <p class="hightlight">Doctoring calves is never easy. Doctoring lots of calves is a nightmare. For producers, nothing takes more time or creates more stress than seeing sick cattle. So how do you get ahead of the problem and address herd health and immunity before it's too late.</p>

  <p class="hieghtlight">This article is about Japanese cuisine. For the ancient Chinese poet, see Su Shi. For other uses, see Sushi (disambiguation)></p>
